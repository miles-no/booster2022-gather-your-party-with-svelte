# Quest 1 - The Mighty Button

#### Lore

_click_ _click_.... Our heroes journey can not start if we can not even click a button!

#### Intro

For consistent design and functionality we wish to create a Button component that can be reused in our application.

The component currently has the 3 variables `variant`, `small` and `disabled`, but they are not exposed, and can not be
set by parent components.

Read about [Component Bindings](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/component-bindings) to find out more.

We also wish to expose the `click` event of the inner button so any parent components, as that is the main use case for
a button.

And lastly our button should also have some content. We wish for anything that is inside our Buttons tag to be reflected
into the inner button. Example: `<Button>The should be displayed inside the button</Button>`

#### Files

- `src/lib/components/button/Button.svelte`

#### Goal

- Expose the variables `variant`, `small` and `disabled` so that they can be set by the parent component.
- Propagate the `click` event from the button to parent components.
- Use `slots` to display the content our Buttons html tag in parent components.

# Quest 3 - Boosting our Heroes stats

#### Lore

Our mighty heroes seem a bit weak. Luckily we are able to assist them by boosting their attributes effects on their
stats.

#### Intro

The point of this task is to use [Reactive Declarations](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/reactive-declarations) to change
one value whenever any referenced values change.

#### Files

#### Goal

- 1 point in **strength** should increase the **minimum damage** with **2**.

- 1 point in **constitution** should increase the **hitpoints** with **5**.
- 1 point in **wisdom** should increase the **mana** with **10**.
- 1 point in **intelligence** should increase the **spellpower** with **2.5**.

# Quest 4 - Skills to desire

#### Lore

Our heroes look mighty powerful! But they do still not seem satisfied... Maybe we should let them train som skills?

#### Intro

The current solution provides a list of skills and those selected. The selection process offers no animation and just snaps.

We want an animation to occur when selecting and removing skills.

#### Files

#### Goal

- Use [Animations](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/animate) and [Transitions](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/transition) to animate the skill selection.

# Quest 5 - Indecisive Heroes

#### Lore

Some of our heroes seem to need help to decide what attributes they have, and are requesting our assistance.

#### Intro

Svelte is full of useful tools for animating changes. Start by looking
into [Motion (Tween/Spring)](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/tweened) and how you can animate the attributes changing.

When this is working for `addPoint` and `subtractPoint` fill inn the `randomize` button. Remember to also update and
animate `pointsRemaining`.

#### Files

- `src/lib/components/attribute-overview/AttributeOverview.svelte`

#### Goal

- Use [Motion (Tween/Spring)](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/tweened) to animate numbers changing.
- Fill inn the `randomize` method with logic to randomly assign attribute points.
