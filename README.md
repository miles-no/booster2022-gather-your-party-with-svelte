# Gather your party with Svelte

## Getting started

0. Make sure you have Node v16 or v17 installed with `node --version`.

1. Clone the repository to your work environment: `git clone https://github.com/miles-no/booster2022-gather-your-party-with-svelte.git`

2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

3. To start the development server and open the application: `npm run dev -- --open`.

## Workshop

All tasks are listed in file `workshop-tasks.md` located in the root of the project.

Both this file and the `workshop-tasks` file can be viewed on the [homepage](http://localhost:3000).

### Solutions

When working with quests there will always be an accompanying solutions file.

If the task is located in `my-quest.Svelte` the solution file will be called `my-quest.SOLUTION.Svelte`.

Use this knowledge at your own discretion, but we HIGHLY recommend not looking at these unless you are out of other options.

## Tips

- To clear local data (characters that have been saved), run `npm run clear-data`.
- If you're unfamiliar with TypeScript and do not wish to use it in your Svelte component files, you can remove
  the `lang="ts"` attribute at the top of the `<script>` tag.
- While it's not necessary, if you like using a code style formatter, `prettier` is set up in this project.
  You can run it in two different ways:
  - If you have it set up in your Editor you can run it via the editor on the file you're working on.
  - Run `npm run format` in the terminal to format all your sourcefiles.

### Building

To build the application run: `npm run build`
